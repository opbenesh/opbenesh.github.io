### **Hugo Blog Setup & Agentic Automation**

#### **1. Core Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Hugo and Git installed on your Mac.

```bash
brew install hugo
git --version
```

#### **2. Initialize the Project**

Create the directory structure and initialize the repository.

```bash
hugo new site my-blog
cd my-blog
git init
```

#### **3. Theme Installation**

Clone the PaperMod theme directly into the `themes` directory.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod
echo 'theme = "PaperMod"' >> hugo.toml
```

#### **4. Configuration**

Update `hugo.toml` with your specific details.

* **baseURL**: `https://[your-username].github.io/`
* **theme**: `PaperMod`

#### **5. Deployment Automation (GitHub Actions)**

1. `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
2. `touch .github/workflows/hugo.yaml`
3. Paste the official Hugo GitHub Action YAML into the file.
4. Navigate to **Settings > Pages** on GitHub.
5. Change **Build and deployment > Source** to **"GitHub Actions"**.

### **6. Agentic Automation (The "Doom Coding" Workflow)**

To minimize manual overhead, use an LLM agent (like Claude Code) to handle metadata and maintenance.

#### **Automate Metadata & Tags**

Instead of manually writing front matter, prompt the agent:

> "Review `content/posts/new-post.md`. Generate a 2-sentence summary for the `description` field and suggest 5 relevant `tags` based on the content. Update the file front matter directly."

#### **Automate the "About" Page**

Keep your bio updated based on your latest projects:

> "Read `README.md` from my Spotify Tracker repo and my last three blog posts. Update `content/about.md` to reflect my current focus on metal music and mobile development."

#### **Pre-Flight Review & Post**

Use the agent as a CI gatekeeper before you push:

> "Check all files in `content/posts/`. Ensure `draft` is set to `false` for completed posts, verify all internal links work, and ensure images are correctly referenced in the `/static` folder. If everything is correct, commit with the message 'Release: [Post Title]' and push to main."

### **7. Essential File Reference**

**CLAUDE.md** (Place in root):

```markdown
# Project Rules
- Always use PaperMod-compatible front matter.
- Tags should be lowercase.
- Summaries should be under 160 characters for SEO.
- Run `hugo server` to validate builds before suggesting a push.
```

**Would you like the specific YAML code for the `hugo.yaml` deployment file?**
