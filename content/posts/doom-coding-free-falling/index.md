> **TL;DR:** I built a fully working Spotify release tracker app over a weekend—entirely from my phone—using Claude Code. Here's how, plus tips for async "doom coding" on the go.

Hosting a weekly "new metal" show at [KZRadio](https://www.kzradio.net/shows/esh) (hello, shameless plug) means I have an ever-renewing deadline for finding new stuff to play, and Spotify's own Release Radar misses 70% of the good stuff. I wanted to revitalize my legacy Spotify release tracker project for a while now, but obviously ain't nobody got time for this sort of things these days.

**THAT ALL CHANGED** when I read a Hacker News article titled ["Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding"](https://github.com/rberg27/doom-coding) (amazing term!). I'm skipping forward a bit, but turns out that these days, the LLM guys allow you to spin up on-demand sandboxes for their coding services, which you can then use to vibe code **ON YOUR FREAKING PHONE** instead of checking out the latest political takeovers on apnews.

So on Friday morning I created an empty GitHub repo, and after a weekend of vibe-Clauding on the go (is this a thing? this should be a thing), I had a fully working app—complete with an AI-generated logo!

<pre style="background:#1a1a1a; color:#0f0; padding:1em; border-radius:8px; font-family:monospace; overflow-x:auto;">
<code>$ esh-tracker track --artist="Turnstile" --since 2025-10-01

  🎵 Turnstile - Dream Logic
     Album: Dream Logic - Single
     Released: 2025-11-14
     URL: https://open.spotify.com/...</code>
</pre>

And the most surprising thing was that building it was **SO. MUCH. FUN.** The async nature is so perfect for meaningless side-projects like these. I actually vibe-coded at the supermarket and while brushing my teeth. Listen, I love to debate the AI bubble doom scenarios as much as the next guy, but please - you have to try it out. You'll REALLY enjoy it. I promise. I liked it so much I'm writing this blog post at 3am for god's sake.

### Try it yourself

I'm going to write a web version of the tracker one day, but feel free to early-adopt:

```bash
pip install esh-tracker
```

Or check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opbenesh/esh-tracker).

## Doom code 101

*   Create an empty, private GitHub repo.
*   Spin up Claude on your phone, go to the Code tab
*   Authorize the GitHub integration and pick your repo
*   Doom code!
*   Iterate!

## Pro tips

*   Optional, but highly recommended: Brainstorm your planned app with your favorite non-coding LLM and ask it to create a spec.
*   Keep a `CLAUDE.md` file for instructions. Claude reads it before proceeding, so that's a good place to put important stuff about your project, priorities, and environment. Think of it like the "Our Core Values" document you never opened at your previous job!
*   This is a super async process. Rate limits, bus inspectors asking for that QR code, your stew getting burnt, etc. Keep a `TODO.md` file and ask Claude to update it, so that resuming tasks (perhaps even with another agent or environment) is always easy.
*   TDD FTW. Ask Claude to create tests for EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE SCENARIO, and remind it to run them every once in a while. This is a great way to help the agent understand whether its task is truly done.
*   One conversation per topic. Start a session, give it a few related tasks, review and merge the PR, and move on. Both you and the agent will concentrate better in this model. Learned anything interesting in this session? Great! Update `CLAUDE.md`.

## Assorted thoughts 

* The blog post actually suggests a local Claude Code + Tailscale + Android terminal, but if I'm already vibe coding, I might as well auto-approve agent code runs, meaning that I definitely don't want the setup running on my local machine (or even a VM on the same network).
*   Unsurprisingly, auto-approve completely changes the interaction model with these agents. Instead of closely supervising every `rm`, the whole thing becomes truly async. Which means that...
*   Figuring out sandboxes is key to all of this, which is why these new container-first services (Claude Code, Google Jules and OpenAI's Codex) are so great. Let's hope they keep underpricing them!
*   One surprising side effect of the async manner is that you can either use your newly free time for non-coding tasks (e.g. making dinner), but
*   You can also use it for performing *other coding tasks* (hello Jevons paradox!). I ended up spending most of my weekend on this.
*   Also - you _can_ actually use these things for non-coding tasks. Data analysis and research feels like a natural next step - put all your csvs file in a GitHub repo and let it run.
